       Hello there! I'm a curious and passionate web developer currently pursuing a Diploma in Computer Science at WITI. I have a deep love for crafting beautiful and functional websites. Whether it's writing clean code, experimenting with new designs, or solving tricky problems, I find joy in every part of the development journey.<br><br>
      I believe in continuous learning, and I'm always excited to explore new technologies and be part of a world where innovation never sleeps. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me sketching, reading about AI, or cheering on fellow women in tech. Let's build the future, one pixel at a time!<br><br>
      Over the past year, I've gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I am continuously working on new projects to improve my skills. I love turning creative ideas into real, interactive websites that people can enjoy and benefit from.<br><br>
      I'm also a strong advocate for digital inclusion and believe technology should be accessible to everyone. That's why I enjoy helping others learn to code and mentoring fellow students whenever I can. Collaboration, innovation, and a touch of creativity are at the heart of everything I do.<br><br>
